# Odin_Calculator
Calculator app based on the Odin Project curriculum 

In this assignment, I was asked to build a functioning calculator that can do basic arithmetic.  The goal was to utilize everything I've learned about Javascript fundamentals up to this point to create a smooth and responsive interface.  In the end, I am very proud of this project as I was able to come up with all of the logic myself, even if it the code may not be the most efficient.

# Features
* The calculator does addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Keyboard support
* The calculator's display face changes based on what the calculator is doing
* Hitting enter (or equals) after solving an equation will repeat the equation using the last number that was input
* The calculator will solve an equation and be ready for a new input when using different operands
* The number on the display will shrink/grow (to a point) to fit the screen
* Positive/Negative button 
* Dividing by zero makes the calculator very upset

# Lessons Learned
* First time utilizing Grid in CSS.  Who would have thought it would be perfect for setting up and organizing a grid of buttons?
* First time utilizing button animations/transitions
* First time using a forEach loop to group a bunch of similar buttons together
* First time implementing keyboard support.
* Getting the HTML elements and Javascript to play nice was a journey.
* Tried my best to not overload the eventlisteners on the buttons and instead refactoring certain checks to seperate functions so that it at least LOOKS less chaotic.

I hope you like it!
